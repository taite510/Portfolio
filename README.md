A portfolio app built with MUI and React, then depolyed on AWS Lambda using the Serverless Framework. Uses [arabold's serverless react boilerplate](https://github.com/arabold/serverless-react-boilerplate) as a starting point.

## Notes

- As of May 2022, this project is not intended to be used outside of displaying my own personal portfolio but you are welcome to clone the repo and give it a try.
